XRX is a new web application architecture that uses XForms on the client, ReST interfaces and XQuery on the server.

The source code is a companion to the XRX Wikibook hosted on the wikibooks.org web site here:

http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/XRX

There are two companion wikibooks that give details about XForms and XQuery:

  1. http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/XForms
  1. http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/XQuery

The XForms example code can be found at this Google Code location:

We are looking for volunteers to write samples.  Please contact Dan McCreary if you are interested in contributing XRX code samples.
